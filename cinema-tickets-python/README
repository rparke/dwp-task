The python environment to run this app is defined in the environment.yml file
This is designed to be run in a container, defined in the Dockerfile

For the sake of simplicity a build of the dockerfile simply copies the contents of this repository as is, rather than with a volume mapping. As a result, any changes will require a fresh build.

## Container Creation
To create the container for running and testing the application run: docker build -t dwp-task:v1.0 -f Dockerfile

## Testing
docker run -it dwp-task:v1.0 pytest

## Running The App
docker run -it dwp-task:v1.0 python -m main
